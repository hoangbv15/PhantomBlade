# Megaman X Phantom Blade #

The aim of this project is to create the best 32 bit style Megaman X fan game possible.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This repository contains the main code, assets (not owned by me), and everything else you need to start building and contributing to the game.
(Note: IntelliJ is recommended)

### How do I get set up? ###

* Download the latest version of IntelliJ and simply import the project
* Make sure Gradle downloads all of the project's dependencies
* To run tests, just create a JUnit run profile and point to the module containing the tests (for example: core)
* Run ./gradlew desktop:dist to create jar, desktop:packr to build to windows binaries, and desktop:zip to do all the above, plus zipping the binaries up.
